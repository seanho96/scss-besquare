title: Functions
---
Functions allow you to define complex operations on SassScript values that you can re-use throughout your stylesheet. 
They make it easy to abstract out common formulas and behaviors in a readable way.

* To include logic for styling - similar to JS functions
* Should  be used to compute & return values

## Example

```SCSS
@function functionName($argument) {
  @return $argument
}
```

title: What is SASS
---

## SASS is CSS with superpowers
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.


## In short
* SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheers
* It is an extension to CSS providing it with more features
* Browsers canâ€™t read SASS hence it has to be compiled to CSS (we will be using node-sass to compile it)
* SASS is a pre-processor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS.
SASS is itself a scripting language whereas SCSS is the main syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax.
* SASS follows strict indentation, SCSS has no strict indentation.
* SASS has a loose syntax with white space and no semicolons, the SCSS resembles more to CSS style and use of semicolons and braces are mandatory.
* SASS file extension is `.sass` and SCSS file extension is `.scss`.

title: Maps
---

Maps in Sass hold **pairs of keys and values**, and make it easy to look up a value by its corresponding key. 
Theyâ€™re written `(<expression>: <expression>, <expression>: <expression>)`. 
The expression before the : is the key, and the expression after is the value associated with that key. 

## Example

```SCSS
// Declaration
$our-custom-font-weights : (
  "regular": 400,
  "medium": 500,
  "bold": 700,
);

// Usage
font-weight: map-get($our-custom-font-weights, bold); // --> font-weight: 700;

```

You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. 
This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.

* Separate files - have modularity (separation of concerns)
* Partial files should start with `_` in their names - to skip being compiled (for e.g. `_button-styles.scss`)
* To use - we use the `@import` syntax

## Example

```SCSS
@import './_button-styles'
```

title: Nesting
---

When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.

Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.

## Note

[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) notation for CSS naming is usually used for best practice of having useful descriptive names

## Example

```SCSS
.main {
  background-color: coral;
  padding: 2rem;

  #{&}__paragraph {
    background-color: teal;
    padding: 1rem;

    &:hover {
      background-color: pink;
    }
  }
}

```
